NOTES:

- We are using Pop!\_OS.

- It's good etiquette to put a "/." at the end of rsync's input (directory)
- `mkdir -p` does not update time accessed when working with a preexisting directory
- We don't need an "upgrade.sh" because the Pop!\_Shop does it all for us

FAQ:

- Q: Why did you make everything sh-compliant?
- A: Masochism

- Q: Was it worth it?
- A: :,)
